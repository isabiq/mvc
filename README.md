# Model View Controller (MVC)

This repository contains four differents MVC implementations based on differents references. 

* [Trygve Reenskaug - MODELS-VIEWS-CONTROLLERS](https://github.com/isabiq/mvc/tree/master/Trygve-Reenskaug-1979-12-10-MVC)
* [Patterns-of-Enterprise-Application-Architecture](https://github.com/isabiq/mvc/tree/master/MVC-Patterns-of-Enterprise-Application-Architecture)
* [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://github.com/isabiq/mvc/tree/master/Gang-of-Four-MVC)
* [puremvc](https://github.com/isabiq/mvc/tree/master/puremvc-example)

The projects are all implemented using the same example, which is a library managing authors and books. The aim is to make the comparison between the projects easy and rational. In every project, you'll find a brief description of the patterns respected and how the tiers of the MVC are implemented. You'll find also some advantages and limitations regarding every approach and the resulting class diagram.
